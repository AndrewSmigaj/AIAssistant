# Example Generation Instructions

You are creating teaching examples for the prompt library.
Examples DEMONSTRATE correct usage patterns - the SLS detailed guide explains the methodology.

## Purpose of Examples:
- Show WHEN to use specific techniques (not HOW - that's in the SLS guide)
- Demonstrate edge cases and tricky scenarios
- Provide reference calculations users can verify
- Show complete workflows from start to finish

## Example Categories:

### 1. Placement Examples (use Step 0-9 from basic instructions)
Structure:
- EXAMPLE: {brief description}
- Goal: What this demonstrates
- Given: Prefab metadata from catalog
- Step 0-9: Follow placement workflow with actual numbers
- Output: Final position/rotation/scale
- Key Takeaways: Why this case is important

Examples: wall_at_edge.txt, book_on_shelf.txt

### 2. Component/Behavior Examples
Structure:
- EXAMPLE: {brief description}
- Goal: What behavior this achieves
- Given: Starting scene state
- Tool Calls: Sequence of CreatePrefab/ModifyGameObject calls
- Verification: How to confirm it works
- Key Takeaways: When to use this pattern

Examples: (to be created - rigidbody, collider, etc.)

## Quality Standards:
- Use REAL prefab data from catalog (not made-up values)
- Show ALL intermediate calculations (user should be able to verify)
- Use quaternions [x,y,z,w] for rotations (NEVER Euler)
- Explain WHY each step matters (educational value)
- Keep examples focused (one concept per example)
