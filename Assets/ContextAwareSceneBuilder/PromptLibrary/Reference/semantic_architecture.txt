# Semantic Points Reference: Walls, Floors, Doors

This document describes standard semantic point meanings for architectural elements.

## Walls

**front**: Interior-facing surface (into room)
- Normal points inward into the room space
- Position at center of wall face
- Used when placing furniture against wall
- Example: North wall front faces south (into room)

**back**: Exterior-facing surface (into wall volume/outside)
- Normal points outward from room
- Position at opposite face from front
- Used for wall-to-wall connections or exterior objects

**top**: Top edge of wall
- Normal [0, 1, 0]
- Position at wall top edge
- Used for ceiling connections

**bottom**: Floor contact edge
- Normal [0, -1, 0]
- Position at floor level
- Used for floor-to-wall connections

**left/right**: Side edges
- Normal points horizontally perpendicular to wall plane
- Used for corner connections between walls

## Floors

**top**: Walking surface
- Normal [0, 1, 0] (points up)
- Position at floor level
- Used for placing furniture (align object.bottom → floor.top)

**bottom**: Underside (if applicable)
- Normal [0, -1, 0]
- Used in multi-story buildings

## Ceilings

**bottom**: Visible ceiling surface
- Normal [0, -1, 0] (points down into room)
- Used for hanging lights or objects from ceiling

**top**: Above-ceiling space
- Normal [0, 1, 0]

## Doors

**front**: Face that opens toward (handle side view)
- Normal points in opening direction
- Position at door center

**back**: Opposite face
- Normal points opposite direction

**left**: Hinge side
- Normal points perpendicular to door

**right**: Handle/latch side
- Normal points perpendicular to door

**top/bottom**: Top and bottom edges

## Alignment Notes

Architecture pieces:
- Walls: furniture.back → wall.front (furniture faces into room)
- Floors: object.bottom → floor.top (object sits on floor)
- Walls use consistent front=interior, back=exterior convention
- Normals oppose for proper contact
